This project focuses on creating a custom implementation of an ArrayList in Javaâ€”a dynamic list structure that can grow in size as more items are added. It is designed using Java Generics, allowing it to store any type of object, such as String, Integer, or user-defined classes. The list automatically resizes its internal array when it runs out of space, making it flexible and efficient for general-purpose use.

The custom list supports a wide range of operations. You can add or remove elements by their index, whether at the beginning, middle, or end of the list. It includes convenient methods like addFirst() and addLast() for inserting items at either end, as well as removeFirst() and removeLast() for removing them. The list also allows you to search for elements using methods like contains() to check for the presence of an item and indexOf() to locate its position. When needed, the entire list can be cleared using the clear() method. All of these features are thoroughly tested using JUnit to ensure their correctness and reliability.
